## Mechanical keyboards

The purpose of this documentation, for my own use, is to document some basic parameters about those mechanical keyboard switches that I am interested in. These are the less common Cherry MX switches (ie, those other than MX blue, MX brown, MX red, and MX black).

This markdown file is intended to a quick reference as to the distinctions between the various switches.

## Switches

| Switch         | Tactile Force (cN) | Actuation force (cN) | Type           | Notes                          |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| MX Clear       | 65                 | 55                   | Tactile        |                                |
| MX White       |                    | 80                   | Clicky         |                                |
| MX Gray        |                    | 80                   | Tactile        | Used for spacebar in MX clear  |
| MX Linear Gray |                    | 80                   | Linear         | Used in space bars in MX black |
| MX Green       |                    | 80                   | Tactile clicky | Meant for space bar usage      |

## Notes about the swithces

* MX linear gray switches are also known as MX dark gray. Users that think that MX black are not stiff enough will sometimes use them for a whole keyboard (MX black by contrast has an actuation force of 60 cN ).
* MX green, MX white, and MX clear are all tactile switches. MX green and white are also clicky switches.
